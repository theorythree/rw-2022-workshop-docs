# S4-12: Projects - Wrap Up and Next Steps

Okay, the moment you’ve been waiting for, let’s take a look at our updated todo list:

1. > ~~Create a feature branch for our project features~~
2. > ~~Create a Model, Controller, Database Migration, Test files, and View files~~
3. > ~~Write our initial suite of tests for projects~~
4. > ~~Create our routes for projects~~
5. > ~~Update our controller CRUD code~~
6. > ~~Update our migration file to build up a projects table in the database~~
7. > ~~Discuss Model relationships and implement our first relationship between clients and projects~~
8. > ~~Finish our ProjectFactory file~~
9. > ~~Update our dummy views for projects~~
10. > ~~Run our tests and fix any issues we have~~
11. > ~~Commit our finished feature, then merge it into main branch~~

Nothing more satisfying than a fully crossed off todo list!

### Summary

We did quite a bit of work in this series. You learned more about the relationships between test, factories, routes, controllers, and views. This connectivity should be starting to sink in, but don’t worry if you’re still unclear about the connections between these parts of the project, we’re going to be repeating these steps more and more as e build out the rest of our application.

## Final thoughts about this series

As you can tell, we’re moving away from the strict TDD as I’ve described it at the beginning of this workshop. This is a normal progression, as you start to grow in your learning. It’s about finding the balance that works for you.

Some people choose to focus heavily on the test, and then fly through the actual coding part. Others choose to write tests the cover the core features, then focus more time and energy on writing the code.

In any case, the goal is to write good code and good tests to confirm our code is good.

We’re going to stick with TDD, and maybe later in the series, I’ll write the tests for you and we can focus on the other parts. I don’t want you to get bogged down trying to learn too much too quickly. Give it some time for all of this to sink in and make sense.
