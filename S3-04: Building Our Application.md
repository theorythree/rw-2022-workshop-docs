# S3-04: Building Our Application

We’ve planned the initial models, views, and controllers for our project, so now it’s time to start building. We’ll use our planning as a guide as we build up various aspects of our project, and as we do, we might find that we need to tweak some of the details. That’s okay, the plan was just designed to get us started, it’s not meant to be written in stone.
